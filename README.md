# [Endpoint Security] Are you sure thatâ€™s an invoice? 
Based on the initial findings, we discovered how the malicious attachment compromised Julianne's workstation:

    A PowerShell command was executed.
    Decoding the payload reveals the starting point of endpoint activities. 

## Investigation Guide
With the following discoveries, we should now proceed with analysing the PowerShell logs to uncover the potential impact of the attack:

    Using the previous findings, we can start our analysis by searching the execution of the initial payload in the PowerShell logs.
    Since the given data is JSON, we can parse it in CLI using the jq command.
    Note that some logs are redundant and do not contain any critical information; hence can be ignored.

## JQ Cheatsheet
jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. This tool can be used in conjunction with other text-processing commands. 

You may use the following table as a guide in parsing the logs in this task.

Note: You must be familiar with the existing fields in a single log.
Parse all JSON into beautified output	

cat powershell.json | jq 
Print all values from a specific field without printing the field	

cat powershell.json | jq '.Field1'
Print all values from a specific field
	

cat powershell.json | jq '{Field1}'
Print values from multiple fields	

cat powershell.json | jq '{Field1, Field2}'
Sort logs based on their Timestamp	

cat powershell.json | jq -s -c 'sort_by(.Timestamp) | .[]'
Sort logs based on their Timestamp and print multiple field values
	

cat powershell.json | jq -s -c 'sort_by(.Timestamp) | .[] | {Field}'
